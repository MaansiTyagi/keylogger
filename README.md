Keyloggers are built for the act of keystroke logging — creating records of everything you type on a computer or mobile keyboard. These are used to quietly monitor your computer activity while you use your devices as normal.

A “keystroke” is just any interaction you make with a button on your keyboard which  may include: Length of the keypress, Time of keypress, Velocity of keypress, Name of the key used
